# Sociussion

Reddit-like social media application created for portfolio and "Object-Oriented Programming" class at the Poznan University of Technology.

I used the repository pattern, which is quite old. The app isn't finished at all. I've pivoted to the other project where I start with clean architecture from scratch ([financity](https://github.com/AdrianKokot/financity)).

## Tech stack

- Frontend: Angular 13, TailwindCSS 3
